# Wavefolder distortion

## Definition

Let $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow [-1;1]$ is a periodic function. Wavefolder distortion is just calculating $f( D*I + P)$

$D$ is the drive amount,

$P$ is the phase of function,

$I$ is the signal input

## Features

### Basic functions

There are 4 basic functions:

- sin
- triangle
- sawtooth
- square

Each has period of 4.

### Function loaded from a .wav file

You can load a function table from a .wav file. The function will have period of 4.

There is graph of the function. You may see zero-crossing points of function and choose it as a phase of the function.
